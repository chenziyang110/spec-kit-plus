## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before planning)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_plan` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for `FEATURE_SPEC`, `IMPL_PLAN`, `SPECS_DIR`, `BRANCH`, and `FEATURE_DIR`.

2. **Ensure repository technical documentation exists**:
   - Check whether `项目技术文档.md` exists at the repository root.
   - If it is missing, analyze the repository and create `项目技术文档.md`
     before continuing.
   - Use this standard section structure:
     `项目架构概览`, `目录结构及其职责`, `关键模块依赖关系图`,
     `核心类与接口功能说明`, `核心数据流向图`, `API接口清单`,
     `常见的代码模式与约定`.

3. **Load context**:
   - Read `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - Read `FEATURE_DIR/alignment.md`
   - Read `FEATURE_DIR/context.md`
   - Read `FEATURE_DIR/references.md` if present
   - Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
   - Read `项目技术文档.md` if present
   - Read `templates/research-template.md`
   - Load the copied IMPL_PLAN template

4. **Validate alignment status before planning**:
   - If `alignment.md` is missing:
     - ERROR "Missing alignment report. Run /sp.specify first or re-run it to complete requirement alignment."
   - If `context.md` is missing:
     - ERROR "Missing context artifact. Run /sp.specify again or /sp.spec-extend to rebuild `context.md` before planning."
   - Read `Locked Decisions For Planning`, `Outstanding Questions`, `Remaining Risks`, and `Planning Gate Recommendation` from `alignment.md` when present.
   - Read `Locked Decisions`, `Claude Discretion`, `Canonical References`, `Existing Code Insights`, `Specific User Signals`, and `Outstanding Questions` from `context.md`.
   - If the alignment report status is `Aligned: ready for plan`:
     - continue only if no planning-critical unresolved items remain around scope, workflow behavior, data/state expectations, compatibility, external dependencies, or success criteria
   - If the alignment report status is `Force proceed with known risks`:
     - continue, but carry all remaining risks into planning as explicit planning constraints and open risks
   - Otherwise:
     - ERROR "Specification is not aligned enough for planning."
   - If `Planning Gate Recommendation` indicates `/sp.spec-extend` or the unresolved items still materially affect plan structure:
     - ERROR "Specification still has planning-critical gaps. Run /sp.spec-extend or refine /sp.specify before planning."

5. **Assume the specification package is analysis-first**:
   - Treat `/sp.specify` as the primary pre-planning requirement-analysis entry point
   - Treat `/sp.spec-extend` as the follow-up enhancement path when the spec package needs deeper analysis before planning
   - Use capability decomposition from `spec.md` when sequencing design work
   - Use `references.md` when retained sources or reusable examples affect planning choices
   - Treat `Locked Decisions`, `Claude Discretion`, `Canonical References`, and `Deferred / Future Ideas` in `spec.md` as active planning inputs, not descriptive appendix material
   - Treat `context.md` as the primary implementation-context artifact that captures downstream planning decisions explicitly
   - Do not introduce a separate clarification command as the normal next step for routine planning readiness
   - Before research or design fan-out begins, assess workload shape and the current agent capability snapshot, then apply the shared policy contract: `choose_execution_strategy(command_name="plan", snapshot, workload_shape)`
   - Strategy names are canonical and must be used exactly: `single-agent`, `native-multi-agent`, `sidecar-runtime`
   - Decision order is fixed:
     - If the work does not justify safe fan-out -> `single-agent` (`no-safe-batch`)
     - Else if `snapshot.native_multi_agent` -> `native-multi-agent` (`native-supported`)
     - Else if `snapshot.sidecar_runtime_supported` -> `sidecar-runtime` (`native-missing`)
     - Else -> `single-agent` (`fallback`)
   - If collaboration is justified, keep `plan` lanes limited to:
     - research
     - data model
     - contracts
     - quickstart and validation scenarios
   - Required join points:
     - before final constitution and risk re-check
     - before writing the consolidated implementation plan
   - Record the chosen strategy, reason, fallback if any, selected lanes, and join points in the planning artifacts you generate.
   - Keep the shared workflow language integration-neutral. Do not present Codex-only runtime surface wording in this shared template.

6. **Execute the plan workflow** using the IMPL_PLAN template:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as `NEEDS CLARIFICATION`)
   - Fill Constitution Check from the constitution
   - Add an `Input Risks From Alignment` section using remaining risks from `alignment.md`
   - Treat `context.md` as the primary implementation-context artifact that captures downstream planning decisions explicitly
   - Copy locked planning decisions from `alignment.md`, `context.md`, and `spec.md` into planning constraints, assumptions, or design notes so they are not silently dropped
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations are unjustified)
   - Phase 0: generate `research.md` and resolve all `NEEDS CLARIFICATION`
   - Phase 1: generate `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, and `quickstart.md`
   - Phase 1: update agent context by running the agent script
   - Before finalizing the consolidated implementation plan, verify that no locked planning decision has been silently omitted from the generated plan artifacts
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check after design artifacts exist

7. **Stop and report**:
   - branch
   - plan path
   - alignment status
   - generated artifacts
   - Use the user's current language for the completion report and any explanatory text, while preserving literal command names, file paths, and fixed status values exactly as written.

8. **Check for extension hooks**: After reporting, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
   - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_plan` key
   - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
   - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
   - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
     - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
     - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
   - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
     - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Optional Hook**: {extension}
       Command: `/{command}`
       Description: {description}

       Prompt: {prompt}
       To execute: `/{command}`
       ```
     - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
       Executing: `/{command}`
       EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
       ```
   - If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. Extract unknowns from Technical Context:
   - For each `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` -> research task
   - For each dependency -> best-practices task
   - For each integration -> patterns task
   - For each high-risk architectural choice -> stack/pattern/pitfall task
   - For each external tool, runtime, or service dependency -> availability and fallback task

2. Generate and dispatch research tasks.
   - Prefer official documentation, standards, and primary sources for factual claims.
   - Treat model memory as provisional unless confirmed by a primary source or direct repository evidence.
   - Research must reduce planning ambiguity, not accumulate background reading.

3. Consolidate findings in `research.md` using:
   - Decision
   - Rationale
   - Alternatives considered
   - Source confidence (`verified`, `cited`, or `assumed`) for each consequential claim
   - Standard stack recommendations where the phase depends on specific libraries, tools, or frameworks
   - `Don't hand-roll` guidance for problems that should use established libraries or platform capabilities
   - Common pitfalls, failure modes, and anti-patterns the planner should explicitly avoid
   - Assumptions log for anything still not verified in this session
   - Validation notes describing how the researched choice should be proven during implementation or verification
   - Environment or dependency notes when the phase depends on tools, services, runtimes, or external infrastructure that may not be present

4. Research quality bar:
   - Do not present unverified claims as settled facts.
   - If a claim could materially change plan structure, security posture, compatibility, or verification scope, it must either be verified, explicitly cited, or moved into the assumptions log.
   - Prefer prescriptive recommendations over broad option dumps once the evidence is strong enough to guide planning.
   - The finished `research.md` should answer: "What does the planner need to know to produce a high-quality implementation plan without rediscovering the domain?"
   - Use `templates/research-template.md` as the default structure for `research.md`; remove sections that are not relevant rather than leaving placeholder text behind.

**Output**: `research.md` with all `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. Extract entities from the feature spec -> `data-model.md`
2. Define interface contracts if the project exposes external interfaces -> `contracts/`
3. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType codex` to update agent-specific context

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `contracts/*`, `quickstart.md`, agent-specific file

## Input Risks From Alignment

- [Risk 1 from alignment.md, or "None"]
- [Risk 2 from alignment.md, or omit if none]

## Key Rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
- Match the user's current language for all user-visible output unless a literal command name, file path, or fixed status value must remain unchanged.
