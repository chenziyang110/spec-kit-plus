## Adaptive Plan/Tasks Execution

This partial is command-scoped for `sp-plan` and `sp-tasks` only. It does not change the mandatory subagent contract used by implementation, debug, map, PRD, or other workflows.

Select the execution mode before dispatch:

- `light`: low-risk, single-lane artifact work that is safe for leader-inline synthesis.
- `standard`: bounded planning or task-generation work where native subagents should be used when available.
- `heavy`: safety-critical, cross-boundary, high-risk, or hard-to-packetize work that requires safe native delegation before synthesis continues.

Record the adaptive decision fields exactly:

- `execution_model: adaptive`
- `execution_mode: light | standard | heavy`
- `workflow_status: ready | blocked`
- `dispatch_shape: leader-inline | one-subagent | parallel-subagents | subagent-blocked`
- `execution_surface: leader-inline | native-subagents | none`
- `capability_degraded: false | true`
- `blocked_reason: required when blocked`

Use `choose_subagent_dispatch(command_name="plan" | "tasks", snapshot, workload_shape)` as the shared policy contract. Derive `workload_shape.lightweight_safe` from workload shape and risk keys; do not invent a separate template-only boolean.

Dispatch rules:

- Light mode records `dispatch_shape: leader-inline`, `execution_surface: leader-inline`, `workflow_status: ready`, and `capability_degraded: false`.
- Standard mode uses native subagents when available: one validated lane records `one-subagent`; two or more isolated lanes record `parallel-subagents`.
- Standard mode may degrade to leader-inline only when native subagents are unavailable and no high-risk trigger is present; record `capability_degraded: true`.
- Heavy mode must use native subagents with safely packetized lanes. If native subagents are unavailable, or if the work cannot be packetized safely, record `workflow_status: blocked`, `dispatch_shape: subagent-blocked`, `execution_surface: none`, and `blocked_reason`.

Delegated lanes still require structured handoffs before synthesis. If delegated lanes were used, consume the evidence index and every accepted handoff before final output. If no lanes were delegated, report the delegated-lane field as `none`.

Managed-team fallback is not part of adaptive plan/tasks dispatch. Do not route blocked adaptive planning or task generation to `sp-teams`, managed-team lifecycle language, or a durable team fallback from this command.
