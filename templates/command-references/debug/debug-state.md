Trigger: when creating, updating, resuming, or archiving the debug session file.

Purpose: preserve debug file protocol, session lifecycle fields, active hypothesis, evidence, state transitions, and archive behavior.

Preserved Contract: the debug file remains the durable source of truth for evidence, hypothesis, verification, and terminal status.

## Debug File Protocol

- **Location**: `.planning/debug/[slug].md`
- **causal_map_completed**: `false` until the Stage 1A causal map, dimension scan, and candidate board are written.
- **investigation_contract_completed**: `false` until the Stage 1B investigation contract is written.
- **log_investigation_plan_completed**: `false` until the Stage 1B log investigation plan is written as its own section.
- **observer_framing_completed**: `false` until the canonical intake package is complete.
- **legacy_session_needs_reintake**: `true` only when a resumed legacy session cannot safely satisfy the canonical intake gate.
- **Current Focus**: OVERWRITE on every update. Reflects exactly what the leader is doing now.
- **Evidence**: APPEND confirmed findings only.
- **Eliminated**: APPEND disproven theories only.
- **Update Rule**: Update the file before taking an action.
- No source-code reads, test reads, log reads, or repro commands are allowed while `observer_framing_completed` is not `true`.

The session file must always make it clear:
- what the observer framing concluded,
- what the active hypothesis is,
- what experiment is being run,
- why the current logs are sufficient or insufficient,
- which layer owns the relevant truth,
- which state is control state versus observation state,
- where the closed loop is currently believed to break,
- and what the next action is if the session resumes later.

## Session Lifecycle

1. **Check for Active Session**
   - Look for existing files in `.planning/debug/*.md` (excluding `resolved/`).
   - If a session exists and no new issue is described, resume it.
   - If a new issue is described, start a new session.
   - If the active session is `awaiting_human_verify` and the user reports another problem, classify it as `same_issue`, `derived_issue`, or `unrelated_issue`.
   - Default to `same_issue` unless repository evidence proves the other two classes.
   - `same_issue` reopens the parent session.
   - `derived_issue` starts a linked follow-up session instead of replacing the parent session.
   - In other words, when repository evidence supports `derived_issue`, start a linked follow-up session rather than reopening the parent directly.
   - `unrelated_issue` starts a separate session and does not auto-close the parent.
   - Record the parent/child relationship in both session files, and after a `derived_issue` follow-up session is resolved, return to the parent session to finish the original human verification before archiving it.

2. **Initialize or Resume**
   - [AGENT] Create or read the session file in `.planning/debug/[slug].md`.
   - Announce the current status, current hypothesis, and immediate next action.
   - For a new session, write `understanding_confirmed: false`, present the Debug Understanding Checkpoint, and wait for confirmation before substantive investigation.
   - For a resumed session with `understanding_confirmed: false`, repair or confirm the checkpoint before reproduction, log review, source/test reads, evidence collection, subagent dispatch, instrumentation, code edits, or validation.

3. **Run the Investigation Protocol**
   - Move through the investigation stages below, starting with the map-backed intake contract before evidence collection begins.
   - **Hard gate**: Do not enter reproduction, log review, test inspection, source-code reads, evidence collection, or fixing until the debug session records `understanding_confirmed: true`, `causal_map_completed: true`, `investigation_contract_completed: true`, `log_investigation_plan_completed: true`, and `observer_framing_completed: true`.
   - Update the debug file before each action.
   - Append every confirmed finding to `Evidence`.
   - Append every disproven theory to `Eliminated`.

4. **Fix and Verify**
   - Apply the minimum code change needed to address the confirmed root cause when `execution_model: leader-inline`.
   - When `execution_model: subagent-assisted`, delegate it through a validated subagent lane and integrate the returned handoff on the leader path.
   - When the fix cannot proceed safely, cannot be packetized, or cannot be verified, record `subagent-blocked` with `execution_surface: none` and a concrete blocked reason instead of layering a speculative fix.
   - Verify with the reproduction steps and relevant tests.

5. **Human Verification**
   - Once the fix is verified by the agent, move into a formal human verification stage instead of resolving immediately.
   - The session closes only after explicit human confirmation or an evidence-backed classification into `same_issue`, `derived_issue`, or `unrelated_issue`.

6. **Archive and Commit**
   - After human confirmation, move the session file to `resolved/`.
   - Commit the fix and the debug documentation.
